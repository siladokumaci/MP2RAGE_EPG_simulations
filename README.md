# MP2RAGE EPG Simulations
Extended Phase Graph (EPG) Simulations of the MP2RAGE Sequence including T2 relaxation, diffusion, radio frequency spoiling, and B1+ variability.
Transverse magnetization is not assumed to be zero but is fed into the next run as an input.

The main function **MP2RAGE_sd** provides simulations of the MP2RAGE sequence signal behaviour using EPG Simulations.
MP2RAGE sequence is described in this reference: Marques JP, Kober T, Krueger G, van der Zwaag W, Van de Moortele PF, Gruetter R. MP2RAGE, a self bias-field corrected sequence for improved segmentation and T1-mapping at high field. Neuroimage. 2010;49:1271-1281.  

The MP2RAGE_sd function requires **EPG_GRE2** and **EPG_GRE3** functions modified from the original EPG_GRE function and the **EPG-X codes** which are available at [https://github.com/mriphysics/EPG-X].

The MP2RAGE_sd function can be called by **run_mp2rage_sd** function for WM/GM/CSF.

## INPUTS ##
- TR is the repetition time of the GRE blocks.
- number_of_reps is the total number of repetitions of the MP2RAGE to reach steady state.
- T1, T2, PD are the relaxation parameters and proton density.
- PE_steps would for instance be 192 for 256 "partitions" (PE-steps in the innermost acquisition loop) with a partial Fourier factor of 6/8.

There are **some lines in the MP2RAGE_sd function that might need modification** for different simulations which are: 
- line 38 for inversion efficiency;
- line 39 for b1_scale (B1+); 
- line 40 for initial phase in the RF phase cycling; 
- line 42 for k-space centre; 
- lines 44-48 for TR_MP2RAGE/TI2/TI1/FA2/FA1;  
- line 56 or 57 should be commented depending on partial Fourier; 
- lines 148-150-152 if PD values different than 0.69, 0.82 or 1 are used for WM/GM/CSF;
- and line 164 is for the name of the mat file saved from the simulations.

## OUTPUTS ##
- It will produce files ending with the B1+ scale (for instance 1P2 for 120% B1+).
- The outputs all_F0 will be the signals. For instance, for FA1 and FA2 changing from 1 to 10 degrees independently, all_F0 will be a 1 x 100 cell array. 
- For the current case, each cell will be of size 197 x 10 where 
197 corresponds to 192 + 5. 192 is resulting from 256 "partitions" * 6/8 with the partial Fourier and 5
is the result of storing the flip angles scaled by the B1+ and the TI1/TI2/TR_MP2RAGE times in the first 5 columns. 
- Partitions is the number of PE steps in the innermost acquisition loop.
- The signal evolution for the TI2 signal is stored in the last column starting from the 6th element so the k-space centre for this case will be (192/3 + 1) + 5 = 70th element of that column and the TI1 signal is stored in the penultimate column.

The code can be written more efficiently but I hope you find this version useful :)
